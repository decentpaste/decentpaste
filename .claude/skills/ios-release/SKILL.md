# iOS Release

Build and prepare iOS app for TestFlight/App Store.

## Critical Warning

**NEVER use `yarn tauri ios dev` or `yarn tauri ios dev --open` for archiving!**
- `dev` creates a DEBUG build pointing to `localhost:1420` (Vite dev server)
- Installing from TestFlight will show blank screen (no dev server on device)
- Always use `yarn tauri ios build` (release mode by default)

## 1. Gather Info

Ask user for:
- Version number (x.x.x) - or keep current if re-uploading
- If re-uploading same version: need to bump build number only

## 2. Update Version/Build Number

**New version release:**
Use `/bump-version` workflow to update all config files.

**Re-uploading same version (e.g., fixing previous bad build):**
Only bump the build number in `tauri.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "iOS": {
      "bundleVersion": "2"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Do NOT edit files in `gen/apple/` directly - they get regenerated. Use tauri.conf.json.

## 3. Setup Share Extension (Conditional)

**Only required after running `yarn tauri ios init`** (regenerates apple folder).

Skip if Share Extension is already configured. To check:
```bash
ls decentpaste-app/src-tauri/gen/apple/ShareExtension/
```

If missing, run:
```bash
cd decentpaste-app && ./tauri-plugin-decentshare/scripts/setup-ios-share-extension.sh
```

## 4. Build & Open Xcode

Ask user to run this in a **separate terminal** (long-running):

```bash
cd decentpaste-app && yarn tauri ios build --open
```

This command:
1. Builds the **frontend in production mode** (bundles assets)
2. Opens Xcode project when frontend build completes

The actual iOS compilation and archiving happens in Xcode (next step).

## 5. Archive & Upload in Xcode

User performs in Xcode:
1. Select scheme: `decentpaste-app_iOS`
2. Select destination: `Any iOS Device (arm64)`
3. Menu: **Product → Archive** (or ⇧⌘A)
4. Wait for archive (~5-15 min)
5. In Organizer: **Distribute App → App Store Connect → Upload**
6. Check "Upload your app's symbols"
7. Use automatic signing
8. Click **Upload**

### Alternative: Full CLI with IPA

Build everything via CLI (no Xcode GUI needed):
```bash
cd decentpaste-app && yarn tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect
```

IPA location: `src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/DecentPaste.ipa`

Upload via Transporter app (free from Mac App Store) or `xcrun altool` with API keys.

## 6. Verify Production Build

To confirm the archive is a production build (not dev):

```bash
# Check for Vite-hashed asset filenames in binary (production indicator)
ARCHIVE=$(ls -td ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/**/*.xcarchive 2>/dev/null | head -1)
strings "$ARCHIVE/Products/Applications/DecentPaste.app/DecentPaste" | grep -E "/assets/index-[A-Za-z0-9]+\.(js|css)"
```

**Production build**: Shows hashed filenames like `/assets/index-BauF9ln8.css`
**Dev build**: No hashed assets (would only show `localhost:1420`)

Note: `localhost:1420` appearing in strings is normal (embedded config) - check for hashed assets.

## 7. TestFlight Configuration

After upload completes (~5-15 min processing):

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) → TestFlight
2. Select the new build
3. Fill **Test Information** (what to test)
4. Answer **Export Compliance** (DecentPaste uses encryption → Yes, but exempt)
5. For external testers: Wait for Beta App Review (~24-48h)

## 8. Report

Report: version updated, build number, build verified as production, upload status.

## Key Files

| File                | Value                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Bundle ID           | `com.decentpaste.application`                |
| Extension Bundle ID | `com.decentpaste.application.ShareExtension` |
| App Group           | `group.com.decentpaste.application`          |
| Team ID             | `SNDGGHFSJ2`                                 |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Solution                                                              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--release` flag error      | Don't use it - `tauri ios build` is release by default                |
| Blank screen on device      | You archived a dev build - rebuild with `yarn tauri ios build --open` |
| Code signing errors         | In Xcode, verify Team selected for BOTH targets                       |
| Share Extension missing     | Run `setup-ios-share-extension.sh`                                    |
| "Build number already used" | Bump `bundle.iOS.bundleVersion` in tauri.conf.json                    |
| Upload fails                | Check Xcode → Settings → Accounts for valid credentials               |
