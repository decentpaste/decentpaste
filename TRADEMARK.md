# DecentPaste Trademark Policy

This policy describes how to use the DecentPaste trademarks, service marks, and logos ("Marks"). While the DecentPaste software is available under the Apache License 2.0, **that license does not include a license to use our Marks**.

## Our Marks

- **Word Mark**: DecentPaste™

## Guiding Principle

Whenever you use our Marks, you must do so in a way that does not mislead anyone. You must not use our Marks in a way that suggests official endorsement, sponsorship, or approval where none exists.
